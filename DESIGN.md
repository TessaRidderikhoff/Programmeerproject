## World map
For the world map, I will need data on the percentage of obese people per country to colour the countries according to the obese population. For the slider, this data is necessary from years 1975 to 2015. I will need 3 different datasets, one for all adults, one for males only and one for females. 

The data will be transformed as such:

| Country | 1975 | 1976 | 1977 | 1978 | etc. |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Afghanistan | ... | ... | ... | ... | |
| Albania | ... | ... | ... | ... | |
| Algeria | ... | ... | ... | ... | | 

| Country       | 1975          | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

Country | 1975 | 1976 | 1977 | etc.
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Afghanistan | ... | ... | ... | ...
Albania | ... | ... | ... | ...
