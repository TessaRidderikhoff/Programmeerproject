# Process report Tessa Ridderikhoff

## Thursday 7-6

### Done
- Divided the html in svgs for each element
- Created map which displays obesity percentage in world
- Created tooltip
- Created legend with interactivity
- Created update function for map for different years

### Problems
- Hard to create slider that works, updating the map works now with a button
- Hard to make the positions of the svgs absolute

### To do
- Make update function for male and female statistics only

## Friday 8-6

### Done
- Created slider over the years, works, but I transform the values of the slider instead of changing the values in the first place
- Created checkboxes for gender information, but they work as buttons as the moment instead of checkboxes
- I gave all svg's standard locations

### To do
- Use the checkboxes as checkboxes: show only the data of the boxes that are checked
- I would prefer not to use a "both" checkbox, but when male and female are both selected that the all-adults dataset is used

## Monday 12-6

### Done
- Made checkboxes that work: there are now a female and male checkbox, and if both checked the world map shows the average for all adults.
- Made scatterplot, only for calories eaten on x-axis, and cardiovascular diseases on y-axis. 

### To do
- Choose what variables are shown on the x-axis and y-axis.
- There are problems with the loading of the data, sometimes the map suddenly becomes black. It also seems that the map sometimes does not show the correct values, possibly of the wrong year.

## Tuesday 13-6

### Done
- The slider can now also update the scatterplot
- The x-axis is a dropdown, but does not do anything yet
- Fixed the data loading problem of the world map (it was because the years were not selected correctly)

### To do
- Crosshair for the scatterplot, so the tooltip doesn't have to hold so much information
- Dropdown for the y-axis
- Update the scatterplot for different datasets
