# Process report Tessa Ridderikhoff

## Thursday 7-6

### Done
- Divided the html in svgs for each element
- Created map which displays obesity percentage in world
- Created tooltip
- Created legend with interactivity
- Created update function for map for different years

### Problems
- Hard to create slider that works, updating the map works now with a button
- Hard to make the positions of the svgs absolute

### To do
- Make update function for male and female statistics only

## Friday 8-6

### Done
- Created slider over the years, works, but I transform the values of the slider instead of changing the values in the first place
- Created checkboxes for gender information, but they work as buttons as the moment instead of checkboxes
- I gave all svg's standard locations

### To do
- Use the checkboxes as checkboxes: show only the data of the boxes that are checked
- I would prefer not to use a "both" checkbox, but when male and female are both selected that the all-adults dataset is used
