### Style guide

## Variable names
- use camelCase
- names should be descriptive
- all names should start with a letter

## Tabs
- Tabs are used instead of 4 spaces for indentation

## Spaces
- Spaces are used in calculations (example: 3 + 4 / 5 instead of 3+4/5).

## Functions
- Functions are written inside curly brackets: {}
- The first curly bracket is on the line of the function name, the last one is seperately on the last line.
- This also applies to for-loops
